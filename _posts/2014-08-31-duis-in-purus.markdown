A biometric signal monitoring platform is a system that allows continuous monitoring and recording of biometric signals. In this research, we delve into sensors, wearable devices, data collection software, and algorithms. Through the utilization of mobile and wearable systems, signals like heart rate, muscle activity, brainwaves, and movement data are collected. These signals are then monitored in real-time via smartphones or computers. By consistently tracking one's health status, the potential for early disease detection and treatment is heightened. The utilization of remote healthcare further facilitates the observation of a patient's condition from a distance. Real-time monitoring of numerical changes allows for the establishment of personalized diagnosis and treatment plans tailored to individuals.
