						<h3>Digital Therapeutics
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p align="justify">
						As a new therapeutic technique based on digital technology, the commercialization and clinical
						application of digital therapeutics (DTx) are increasing, and the demand for expansion to new
						clinical fields is remarkably high. However, the use of DTx as a general medical component is
						still
						ambiguous, and this ambiguity may be owing to a lack of consensus on a definition, in addition
						to
						insufficiencies in research and development, clinical trials, standardization of regulatory
						frameworks, and technological maturity. In this study, we conduct an in-depth investigation and
						analysis of definitions, clinical trials, commercial products, and the regulatory status related
						to
						DTx using published literature, ClinicalTrials.gov, and web pages of regulatory and private
						organizations in several countries. Subsequently, we suggest the necessity and considerations
						for
						international agreements on the definition and characteristics of DTx, focusing on the
						commercialization characteristics. In addition, we discuss the status and considerations of
						clinical
						research, key technology factors, and the direction of regulatory developments. In conclusion,
						for
						the successful settlement of DTx, real-world evidence-based validation should be strengthened by
						establishing a cooperative system between researchers, manufacturers, and governments, and there
						should be effective technologies and regulatory systems for overcoming engagement barriers of
						DTx.

						</header>
						<p align="justify">A Sankey diagram was utilized to analyze trends in indication, institution,
							country, trial type, intervention, and major outcomes. Between 2010 and 2022, a total of 31
							clinical trials related to digital therapeutics were identified on the ClinicalTrials.gov
							website using the keyword “Digital therapeutics”. The clinical trials were conducted by a
							variety of institutions, including pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, research institutes,
							medical consortia, universities, and corporations. These trials were carried out in multiple
							countries, including the United States, Europe, Switzerland, Finland, South Korea, Italy,
							Brazil, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, Israel, and Poland. The clinical trials employed
							interventions such as parallel, single, crossover, and factorial designs, with primary
							objectives that included treatment, research, prevention, diagnosis, supportive care, and
							basic
							science.

							<h3>Saneky diagram depicting the major indications and regulatory status of commercial
								digital
								therapeutics
							</h3>
						</header>
						<p align="justify">Sankey diagrams were employed to analyze trends in the types of indications,
							regulatory agency types, and class types for commercial digital therapeutic devices. The
							investigation focused on products listed on the DTA, DiGA, and mhealthbelgium websites, as
							well
							as products that had received FDA approval listed in the FDA medical device database.
							Regulatory
							authorities for each product were also investigated. Commercial digital therapeutics are
							primarily launched for indications related to chronic conditions, psychiatry, and neurology,
							with additional products available for urinary incontinence, ear disorders, hip and knee
							arthroplasty, tinnitus, irritable bowel syndrome, and vaginismus. Most commercial products
							have
							received approval from the FDA and CE regulatory agencies, while others have been approved
							by
							Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) and the Medicines and Healthcare
							products
							Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
