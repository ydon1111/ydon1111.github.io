							<p>A Sankey diagram was utilized to analyze trends in indication, institution,
								country, trial type, intervention, and major outcomes. Between 2010 and 2022, a total of 31
								clinical trials related to digital therapeutics were identified on the ClinicalTrials.gov
								website using the keyword “Digital therapeutics”. The clinical trials were conducted by a
								variety of institutions, including pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, research institutes,
								medical consortia, universities, and corporations. These trials were carried out in multiple
								countries, including the United States, Europe, Switzerland, Finland, South Korea, Italy,
								Brazil, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, Israel, and Poland. The clinical trials employed
								interventions such as parallel, single, crossover, and factorial designs, with primary
								objectives that included treatment, research, prevention, diagnosis, supportive care, and
								basic
								science.

								<h3>Saneky diagram depicting the major indications and regulatory status of commercial
									digital
									therapeutics
								</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Sankey diagrams were employed to analyze trends in the types of indications,
								regulatory agency types, and class types for commercial digital therapeutic devices. The
								investigation focused on products listed on the DTA, DiGA, and mhealthbelgium websites, as
								well
								as products that had received FDA approval listed in the FDA medical device database.
								Regulatory
								authorities for each product were also investigated. Commercial digital therapeutics are
								primarily launched for indications related to chronic conditions, psychiatry, and neurology,
								with additional products available for urinary incontinence, ear disorders, hip and knee
								arthroplasty, tinnitus, irritable bowel syndrome, and vaginismus. Most commercial products
								have
								received approval from the FDA and CE regulatory agencies, while others have been approved
								by
								Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) and the Medicines and Healthcare
								products
								Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
