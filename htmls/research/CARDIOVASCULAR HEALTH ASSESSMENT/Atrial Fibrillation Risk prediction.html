					<h3>AF prediction

					</h3>
				</header>

				<p align="justify">
					Importance of early diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation continues to grow, but without dignositic and
					prognostic technologies, approaching to recovery/cure is challenging. Integration of genome-wide
					association studies(GWAS) and clinical information is used to develop predictive model, which
					increases the early detection rate of atrial fibrillation and enables the prediction of its
					prognosis. Discovering specific genetic markers related to the disease through artificial
					intelligence(AI), which may not be identified using conventional statistical methods, will improve
					individual's prediction of potential risk of atrial fibrillation based on their genetic
					characteristics. Our research aims to improve the accuracy of predicting atrial fibrillation to a
					clinical level and expects to be an expanded use of a diagnositc system for other diseases. Using
					genetic data as the component of the fusion of heterogeneous data, we expect the development of
					high-precision diagnostic technology.
