					<h3>Pain assessment


					</h3>
				</header>

				<p align="justify">
					The goal of this research is to quantitatively measure the subjective experience of pain for
					individuals using signals emitted by our bodies. In this research, technology is developed to
					monitor pain in individuals who have difficulty expressing their pain, such as patients under
					anesthesia during surgery. If an accurate method of measuring pain can be established, physicians
					can administer appropriate amounts of anesthesia or pain-relieving medications during surgery.
					Furthermore, post-surgery, unnecessary medication usage can be curtailed, potentially improving
					patient outcomes.

					<p align="justify">The purpose of this item description is to quantitatively assess a patient's
						acute pain through HR (Heart Rate) measurements. Furthermore, it aims to utilize the patient's
						HR values for early prediction of pain, enabling personalized treatment strategies to be
						implemented.

					<p align="justify">In the project focusing on the diagnosis and prognosis of Atrial Fibrillation
						(AF), genetic and clinical information is being utilized to discern atrial fibrillation
						patterns. The project aims to analyze and predict the diagnosis and prognosis of atrial
						fibrillation, utilizing atrial geometry and electrophysiological data.
