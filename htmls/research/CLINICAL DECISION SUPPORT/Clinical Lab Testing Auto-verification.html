					<h3>Clinical Lab Testing Auto-verification



					</h3>
				</header>

				<p align="justify">
					AMC conducts blood (serum) general chemistry tests on 8,000 samples daily, one of the most prevalent
					diagnostic lab tests. Before reporting results, examiners manually review each or employ an
					automatic verification algorithm. Given that most cases (99%) are error-free, manual review is
					inefficient. The auto-verification algorithm, often a simple rule-based combination, has a low pass
					rate due to strict criteria, leading to additional manual reviews and delays. AMC's rule-based
					auto-verification has a pass rate of 60-70%, meaning 20,000 to 30,000 test results from over 2,000
					samples are re-verified daily.

						<h3>Automating clinical lab testing using AI

						</h3>
					</header>
					<p align="justify">This study aims to develop a reliable auto-verification algorithm for frequently prescribed general chemical tests, with goals including AI application for verification and feedback mechanisms for appropriate follow-up actions. 
						Development of technology that automatically verifies general chemical test results by applying artificial intelligence instead of rule-based algorithms
						Development of technology that feeds back appropriate follow-up actions (re-examination, re-collection) according to the verification results.
