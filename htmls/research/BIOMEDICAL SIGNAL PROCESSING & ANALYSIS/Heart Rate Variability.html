					<h3>Heart Rate Variability

					</h3>
				</header>

				<p align="justify">
					Heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological measurement that assesses the variations in time
					intervals between successive heartbeats, primarily regulated by the autonomic nervous system. It
					serves as an important indicator of cardiac health and autonomic nervous system function. HRV
					analysis is crucial in clinical settings for evaluating conditions like cardiovascular disease,
					autonomic neuropathy, and stress-related disorders. Reduced HRV often correlates with increased
					sympathetic nervous system dominance and can indicate an increased risk of adverse cardiac events,
					making it a valuable tool for risk assessment and disease management in medical practice.

					</header>
					<p align="justify"> This topic encompasses an exploration of the essential prerequisites for HRV
						analysis, the procedures and methods employed in HRV analysis, the requisite data recording
						duration, and the ramifications of inaccuracies in beat interval detection on HRV analysis. It
						also provides solutions to rectify such inaccuracies, ensuring the accurate execution of HRV
						analysis.

						<h3>HRV analysis

						</h3>
					</header>
					<p align="justify">Our research focuses on the relationship between HRV and the autonomic nervous
						system. We aim to observe HRV changes in various human conditions and environmental settings to
						trace autonomic nervous system activity. This research will deepen our understanding of the
						connection between HRV and the autonomic nervous system, potentially providing valuable insights
						into health improvement, stress management, and psychological stability.
