					<h3>Photoplethysmogram Analysis
					</h3>
				</header>

				<p align="justify">
					PPG (Photoplethysmography) is a technology that measures heart rate and blood flow information by
					utilizing reflected light. Placed on the skin, sensors analyze changes in the absorption and
					reflection of light, allowing for the measurement of parameters such as heart rate, heart rate
					variability, and blood flow status. This technology finds primary applications in the field of
					healthcare, with significant clinical potential for monitoring cardiovascular health, diagnosing
					heart conditions, and tracking sleep patterns. Furthermore, it can be harnessed through wearable
					devices for routine health monitoring, offering personalized healthcare services. In the future, PPG
					is expected to play a pivotal role in healthcare management and early disease detection.
