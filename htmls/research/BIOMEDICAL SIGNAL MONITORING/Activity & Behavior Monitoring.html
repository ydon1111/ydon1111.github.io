						<h3>Accelerometry (Gait Monitoring)

						</h3>
					</header>
					<p align="justify">Gait is a effective parameter for detecting early signs of neurodegenerative
						diseases. We're studying the detection of abnormal gait patterns through gait monitoring,
						employing the capabilities of acceleration sensors. Given that acceleration sensors are already
						standard features in widely-used devices like smartphone and smartwatches, we anticipate a
						future where gait monitoring becomes seamlessly integrated into our daily routines, offering
						invaluable insights into our well-being.

						<h3>Smart Insole-based Gait analysis

						</h3>
					</header>
					<p align="justify">Smart insole-based gait monitoring is a technology that involves embedding
						sensors and data-processing capabilities within insoles worn inside footwear. These sensors
						continuously collect data about a person's walking pattern, including parameters like step
						length, cadence, foot pressure distribution, and posture. It aids in diagnosing gait disorders,
						monitoring rehabilitation, and optimizing athletic performance through real-time feedback.
