						<h3>Wearable Blood Pressure Monitoring
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p align="justify">Our ongoing research endeavors to provide a promising method for estimating continuous blood
						pressure waveforms without the need for uncomfortable cuff pressurization. By harnessing the
						potential of multimodal measurement techniques, integrating multi-wavelength optical sensors and
						multi-channel pressure sensors, we're on the brink of transforming blood pressure monitoring
						into a more comfortable and accessible experience.

						<h3>Non-Constrained Sleep Monitoring
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p align="justify">Sleep, a fundamental aspect occupying nearly one-third of our lives, holds a treasure trove of insights into our physical and mental well-being. Our ongoing research is dedicated to the development of cutting-edge systems and analysis technologies designed to unveil the mysteries of sleep without any physical constraints. While the technology is still undergoing rigorous testing and refinement, we are committed to revolutionizing the way we understand and monitor our vital physiological activity during this essential restorative process.
