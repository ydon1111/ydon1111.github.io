					<h3>High-Risk Patient Monitoring


					</h3>

				<p align="justify">
					The purpose of this project is to establish a platform for real-time monitoring of physiological
					data of high-risk patients among those who are not continuously monitored in the hospital, including
					general inpatients, emergency patients, and patients waiting for treatment. The goal is to develop
					technology for collecting patient physiological information (heart rate, activity level) using
					personal wearable devices and to aim for the development of algorithms for detecting abnormal and
					anomalous states based on the collected patient physiological data.

					<p align="justify">The figure shows that is to build a platform capable of collecting location
						information, heart rate, and activity level data for various high-risk groups within the
						hospital. Heart rate and activity levels are collected from wearable watches and are integrated
						with the platform server via WiFi communication. Location information is collected through BLE
						(Bluetooth Low Energy) communication between the wearable watch and the location information
						scanner.
