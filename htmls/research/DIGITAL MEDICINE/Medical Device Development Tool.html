					<p align="justify">The purpose of this project is to explore the sleep analysis capabilities of Home
						Sleep Apnea Testing (HSAT) as an alternative to the traditionally used Polysomnography (PSG).
						Our primary focus is to scrutinize approval trends for sleep analysis devices, elucidate their
						evaluation criteria, and establish a framework for the universal and objective assessment of
						devices that are currently self-verified by manufacturers. Furthermore, by developing a
						simulator tailored to generate events associated with sleep disorders and stages, we aim to
						enhance clinical efficiency and reliability. Ultimately, our research aims to set a robust and
						objective foundation for the evaluation of sleep analysis technology.
