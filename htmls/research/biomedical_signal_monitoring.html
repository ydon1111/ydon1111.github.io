					<h3>Physiological Monitoring
					</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					Our pioneering research focuses on the comprehensive realm of IoT-based bio-signal monitoring,
					encompassing the development of cutting-edge sensors, robust systems, innovative applications, and
					advanced algorithms. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare, our mission revolves
					around creating a user-friendly and accessible ecosystem, enabling individuals to seamlessly monitor
					their well-being in diverse settings, from hospital environments to the rhythms of everyday life.
					Our extensive portfolio of breakthrough technologies spans the monitoring of vital human parameters,
					including blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration, gait analysis, and sleep patterns.
					Through this holistic approach, we are dedicated to transforming the landscape of personal health
					management, contributing to healthier, more informed lives for individuals around the world.

						<h3>Wearable Blood Pressure Monitoring
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Our ongoing research endeavors to provide a promising method for estimating continuous blood
						pressure waveforms without the need for uncomfortable cuff pressurization. By harnessing the
						potential of multimodal measurement techniques, integrating multi-wavelength optical sensors and
						multi-channel pressure sensors, we're on the brink of transforming blood pressure monitoring
						into a more comfortable and accessible experience.
