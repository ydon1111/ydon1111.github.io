					<h3>Digital Therapeutics


					</h3>
				</header>

				<p align="justify">
					As a new therapeutic technique based on digital technology, the commercialization and clinical
					application of digital therapeutics (DTx) are increasing, and the demand for expansion to new
					clinical fields is remarkably high. However, the use of DTx as a general medical component is still
					ambiguous, and this ambiguity may be owing to a lack of consensus on a definition, in addition to
					insufficiencies in research and development, clinical trials, standardization of regulatory
					frameworks, and technological maturity. In this study, we conduct an in-depth investigation and
					analysis of definitions, clinical trials, commercial products, and the regulatory status related to
					DTx using published literature, ClinicalTrials.gov, and web pages of regulatory and private
					organizations in several countries. Subsequently, we suggest the necessity and considerations for
					international agreements on the definition and characteristics of DTx, focusing on the
					commercialization characteristics. In addition, we discuss the status and considerations of clinical
					research, key technology factors, and the direction of regulatory developments. In conclusion, for
					the successful settlement of DTx, real-world evidence-based validation should be strengthened by
					establishing a cooperative system between researchers, manufacturers, and governments, and there
					should be effective technologies and regulatory systems for overcoming engagement barriers of DTx.

					<p align="justify">A Sankey diagram was utilized to analyze trends in indication, institution,
						country, trial type, intervention, and major outcomes. Between 2010 and 2022, a total of 31
						clinical trials related to digital therapeutics were identified on the ClinicalTrials.gov
						website using the keyword “Digital therapeutics”. The clinical trials were conducted by a
						variety of institutions, including pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, research institutes,
						medical consortia, universities, and corporations. These trials were carried out in multiple
						countries, including the United States, Europe, Switzerland, Finland, South Korea, Italy,
						Brazil, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, Israel, and Poland. The clinical trials employed
						interventions such as parallel, single, crossover, and factorial designs, with primary
						objectives that included treatment, research, prevention, diagnosis, supportive care, and basic
						science.

						<h3>Saneky diagram depicting the major indications and regulatory status of commercial digital

						</h3>
					</header>
					<p align="justify">Sankey diagrams were employed to analyze trends in the types of indications,
						regulatory agency types, and class types for commercial digital therapeutic devices. The
						investigation focused on products listed on the DTA, DiGA, and mhealthbelgium websites, as well
						as products that had received FDA approval listed in the FDA medical device database. Regulatory
						authorities for each product were also investigated. Commercial digital therapeutics are
						primarily launched for indications related to chronic conditions, psychiatry, and neurology,
						with additional products available for urinary incontinence, ear disorders, hip and knee
						arthroplasty, tinnitus, irritable bowel syndrome, and vaginismus. Most commercial products have
						received approval from the FDA and CE regulatory agencies, while others have been approved by
						Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) and the Medicines and Healthcare products
						Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
